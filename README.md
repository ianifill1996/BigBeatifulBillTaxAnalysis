# Big Beautiful Bill â€“ Tax Policy Simulation
This project simulates the impact of four different U.S. federal tax policy scenarios on household income across income groups and racial demographics. It calculates estimated taxes, effective tax rates, net income after tax, and total federal revenue under each scenario.

## Project Overview
The simulation models the following tax policies:

- Current Tax Code  
- Option A â€“ Regressive Adjustment  
- Option B â€“ Progressive Reform  
- Option C â€“ Balanced Bracket Plan  

It helps analyze how different income groups and racial/ethnic populations would be affected by changes in tax brackets and rates.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas) â€” for data processing and tax calculations  
- Tableau Public â€” for creating interactive visualizations  
- Excel â€” for organizing and cleaning source data

## Tax Simulation Script
The main tax simulation logic is in:

- [simulate_policy.py](./analysis/simulate_policy.py)

This script processes all policy scenarios and exports final simulation results to the `/data` folder.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Make sure all CSV data files are placed in the `data/` directory.  
2. Run the Python script to generate updated simulation results:

bash

python simulate_policy.py
Open Tableau Public and import the generated CSV files:
combined_simulation_results.csv
combined_race_results.csv
revenue_summary.csv (optional)
Explore the dashboards to analyze tax impacts by income and race.

##Dashboards
Income Impact by Policy: Visualizes estimated tax, effective tax rate, and net income for different income groups under each policy.
Racial Impact of Tax Policy: Compares tax burden and net income across racial/ethnic groups under each policy.
Revenue Summary: Compares total estimated federal revenue generated by each policy option.

##Key Insights
Option B provides significant relief to low-income households.
Option A favors high-income groups but reduces federal revenue.
Some racial groups experience slightly different tax burdens depending on the policy.
